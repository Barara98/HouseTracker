# HouseTracker 
Purpose:
This project tracks if all household members are home by checking which devices are connected to the home Wi-Fi.

## How It Works:
Router Scraping: Logs into the router to fetch connected devices.
Data Matching: Compares the connected devices with a list of known MAC addresses to identify who's home.
Automation & Manual Trigger: The system runs automatically every 60 seconds, but can be manually triggered for real-time data.

## Technologies Used:
Python
Selenium: For scraping the routerâ€™s web interface.
Pandas: For data processing.
BeautifulSoup: For HTML parsing.
Threading: For handling manual data fetching alongside automated checks.

## Setup:
### 1.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
### 2.Run the system:
python main.py

Press 'm' during execution for manual fetching.

**Stay updated on who's home!**
